# Readable code 🔍

Watch the result of this project >> [here]()

## 🎯 Objectives
- To be able to make decisions about when and how to refactor less readable code.
- To be able to adhere to known PHP code standards like PSR12.
- To be able to think critically about code principles and not follow them blindly.

## ✔️ Specifications
### 🌱 Must-haves
- Have a look at [this code](experimental.php) and try to understand what it does.
- Read the following article [Jason McCreary on writing clean code](https://dev.to/gonedark/writing-clean-code)
- Have the code follow a consistent writing standard. For now, we'll roll with the widely used [PSR12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). 
- Rewrite the file in a way that would improve readability for _you_.
- Don't install PHP codesniffer (yet).
- When you are done, discuss your solution in groups of two.

###  💡 Tips
- Don't aim for perfect all the time, aim for good enough / continuous improvement.
- When refactoring, focus on one section (or one thing) first (e.g. a specific function or clear naming).
- Work in small steps. Write these as separate [to-do's](https://dev.to/razbakov/todo-in-code-b) if you like. Test after every step and use small commits when you're sure everything still works.
- When in doubt what approach is better, think "what would help me to understand this quickly if I see it again a year from now".
- Be critical: if you think a certain tip isn't beneficial to your code, ignore or tweak it.
- When getting used to a standard, don't jump to auto-rewrites immediately. Get used to write code following the standard yourself first.
